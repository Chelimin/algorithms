## Lyrics:

> 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.

> Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

These two verses repeat until you have 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

> 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.

> Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

and when there are no more beer bottles left:

> No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.

> Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
